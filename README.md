--Introduction--

"Covid-19-Data-Analysis" is a data analysis project focused on studying the impact and trends of the Covid-19 pandemic. The project aims to analyze and visualize Covid-19 data from various reliable sources, such as public health organizations and official government reports.

--Problem Aimed to Solve--

Covid 19 second wave was much more devastating for India than the first wave, with shortages of hospital beds, vaccines, oxygen cylinders, and other medical supplies. Analyzing the covid19 data will help better prepare to deal with future threats.

--Data Description--

1. COVID-19_Timeseries: This file contains Python code related to data extraction, data cleaning, and converting it to a CSV file of a 7-day moving average time series.
2. Covid19_State: This file contains Python code related to data extraction, data cleaning, and converting it to a CSV file of the State's data.
3. Covid-19_Districts:  This file contains Python code related to data extraction, data cleaning, and converting it to a CSV file of Districts data.
4. Covid19_SQL: This file contains SQL queries of given problem statements for analysis.
5. C19 final Dashboard: This file contains Dashboard Visualization analysis of Covid 19 data.

--Methodolgy--

The project involves collecting and processing Covid-19 data, including the number of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, testing rates, and other relevant metrics. It utilizes data analysis techniques and statistical modeling to gain insights into the spread of the virus, its impact on different regions or demographics, and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

--Results--

Through data visualization, the project presents the findings in a visually engaging manner, using charts, graphs, and maps. These visual representations help to understand the patterns, trends, and disparities related to Covid-19, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and develop appropriate response measures.

--Challenges--

1. As all of our team members are working professionals, we were finding difficulty in managing time 
and the time availability of each team member is different.
Firstly, we brainstormed and formed a flowchart of works that helped us be on track.
We allocated the work according to each personâ€™s time availability and task priority.
2. One of the main challenges faced in this project is collecting data from JSON using Python API.


Overall, The "Covid-19-Data-Analysis" project serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the general public interested in gaining insights into the global or regional dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic. It aims to contribute to the collective knowledge surrounding the virus, aid in informed decision-making, and support efforts to combat and mitigate its effects on public health and society as a whole.
